### Description of data and SAS and R codes for reproducing the results of this article:
#### [File name: originaldata](https://github.com/UCSFGeriatrics/multiple-outcomes-selection/blob/master/originaldata.csv)
File format: .csv
Description: HRS data with 39 predictors and 4 outcomes of 5,531 respondents
#### File name: R_LASSOselection
File format: .R
Description: R code to perform LASSO Selection based on Optimal Î» at Minimum BIC
#### File name: 1.SAS_BICbackwardIndOutcomeCR
File format: .txt
Description: SAS code to perform BIC backward elimination by Outcome using HRS original dataset. It uses Cox regression for Death, and Competing-risk regression for rest of outcomes.
#### File name: 2.SAS_BICbackwardIndOutcomeCox
File format: .txt
Description: SAS code to perform BIC backward elimination by Outcome using HRS original dataset. It uses Cox regression for 4 outcomes and Wolbers et. al (2009) adaptation to the Competing-risk settings.
#### File name: 3.SAS_baBICbackwardCR
File format: .txt
Description: SAS code to perform best average BIC (baBIC) backward elimination using HRS original dataset. It uses Cox regression for Death, and Competing-risk regression for rest of outcomes. baBIC=absolute(BICk-BICbest)/absolute(BICfull-BICbest): BICfull and BICbest are the BICs of the full and best individual models.
